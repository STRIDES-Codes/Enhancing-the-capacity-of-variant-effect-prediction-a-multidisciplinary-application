##  SWAAT - Structural Workflow for Annotating ADME Targets
This work is to update and upgrade SWAAT. SWAAT is a workflow that uses structural properties of missense variants to predict the likely outcome (deleterious, benign). There are three main areas to be addressed.

## TASK 1 - Replace the Transvar based mapping of protein and genomic coordinates part of the workflow

## TASK 2 - Assess additional machine learning methods for SWAATS's classification functions

## TASK 3 - Run SWAAT on a webserver
